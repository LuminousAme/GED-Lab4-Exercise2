# GED-Lab4-Exercise2

I attached the health system to a singleton called Health that allows the health to be read or set from an instance using Health.instance.GetHealth() or Health.instance.SetHealth(int hp)
I also set up an observer with an event so that it plays a sound effect every time the player collides with the enemy object, that is all that was asked of us for the lab
this is the sound effect used https://soundbible.com/995-Jab.html
